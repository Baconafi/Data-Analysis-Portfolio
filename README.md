# Data-Analysis-Portfolio
Analyzing data with Python and SQL - different datasets

In the DataCamp files:
- For the [Data Analyst Associate Exam](DataCamp/Data-Analyst-Associate/Data_Analyst_Associate_Practical_Exam_Submission.ipynb) I used PostgresSQL to clean and display the data according to what was asked, and for the charts I used Python. At this point I didn't know much about pyplot or seaborn so my code is very rough.
- For the [Data Analyst Professional Exam](DataCamp/Data-Analyst-Professional/Data_Analyst_Professional_Practical_Exam_Submission.ipynb) I used Python for cleaning and displaying charts, as to this point, the course for the Professional certification was all about Python.
